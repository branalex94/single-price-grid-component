## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I learned how to better recognize by eye the sizes of fonts as well as boxes to be more loyal to the original design.

### Continued development

I plan on learning how to use grid even more, as I've only been using it in a very basic way.
